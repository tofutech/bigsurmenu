# Big Sur Menu for Gnome Desktop

### This is a fork of **"Big Sur Menu"** that I have modified to work with GNOME 40.


## INSTALLATION

To do a manual installation, all you have to do is unzip the file to obtain a folder that you must move to the path: 

`/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

To see the `/.local/` folder you need to access the hidden files and for that you must first press the `"ctrl + h"` keys or go to the Nautilus menu and check the `Show Hidden Files` box.
